# Cursor AI Rules for ML Project Template

## Project Context
This is a machine learning project template using:
- Python 3.11+ with uv for dependency management
- Ruff for code formatting and linting
- pytest for testing
- Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- Apptainer for containerization
- Slurm for HPC job scheduling

## Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 with line length of 100 characters
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Include docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Format code with ruff before committing
- Run tests with pytest

## File Organization
- Source code goes in `src/`
- Tests go in `tests/`
- Scripts go in `scripts/`
- Configuration files go in `config/`
- Slurm job scripts go in `slurm/`

## When Making Changes
1. Format code: `uv run ruff format .`
2. Check linting: `uv run ruff check .`
3. Run tests: `uv run pytest`
4. Update dependencies: Edit `pyproject.toml`, then run `uv lock`

## ML Best Practices
- Use W&B for experiment tracking
- Store hyperparameters in config files
- Keep data in `data/` directory
- Save checkpoints to `checkpoints/`
- Log training runs to `logs/`
